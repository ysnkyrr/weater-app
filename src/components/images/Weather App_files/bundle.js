  /**
   * Utility function to handle redirects returned from an action or loader.
   * Normally, a redirect "replaces" the navigation that triggered it.  So, for
   * example:
   *
   *  - user is on /a
   *  - user clicks a link to /b
   *  - loader for /b redirects to /c
   *
   * In a non-JS app the browser would track the in-flight navigation to /b and
   * then replace it with /c when it encountered the redirect response.  In
   * the end it would only ever update the URL bar with /c.
   *
   * In client-side routing using pushState/replaceState, we aim to emulate
   * this behavior and we also do not update history until the end of the
   * navigation (including processed redirects).  This means that we never
   * actually touch history until we've processed redirects, so we just use
   * the history action from the original navigation (PUSH or REPLACE).

      // might unsuspend it, and vice versa. The only reason to suspend is
      // because you think you might want to restart before committing. However,
      // it doesn't make sense to restart only while in the period we're suspended.
      //
      // Restarting too aggressively is also not good because it starves out any
      // intermediate loading state. So we use heuristics to determine when.
      // Suspense Heuristics
      //
      // If nothing threw a Promise or all the same fallbacks are already showing,

      // If this is an initial render of a new tree of Suspense boundaries and
      // those trigger a fallback, then don't suspend/restart. We want to ensure
      // that we can show the initial loading state as quickly as possible.
      //
      // If we hit a "Delayed" case, such as when we'd switch from content back into
      // a fallback, then we should always suspend/restart. Transitions apply
      // to this case. If none is defined, JND is used instead.
      //
      // If we're already showing a fallback and it gets "retried", allowing us to show
      // another level, but there's still an inner boundary that would show a fallback,
      // then we suspend/restart for 500ms since the last time we showed a fallback
      // anywhere in the tree. This effectively throttles progressive loading into a
      // consistent train of commits. This also gives us an opportunity to restart to
      // get to the completed state slightly earlier.
      //

      // 1) "delayed", 2) "initial render", 3) "retry".

      // state, no effects. Same as what we do for Offscreen (except that
      // Offscreen doesn't have the first render pass).

      // Second is hydration. During hydration, the Suspense fiber has a slightly
      // different layout, where the child points to a dehydrated fragment, which
      // contains the DOM rendered by the server.
      //
      // Third, even if you set all that aside, Suspense is like error boundaries in
      // that we first we try to render one tree, and if that fails, we render again
      // and switch to a different tree. Like a try/catch block. So we have to track
